= Introduction =

Cryptanalysis (from the Greek _kryptós_, "hidden", and _analýein_, "to loosen" or "to untie") is the study of methods for obtaining the meaning of encrypted information, without access to the secret information which is normally required to do so.

= Classical Cryptanalysis =

    * Frequency Analysis
    * Index of Coincidence
    * Kasiski Examination

= Modern Cryptanalysis =

  == Assumption ==

  [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerckhoffs'_principle Kerckhoffs' Principle] (aka Kerckhoffs' Assumption, Axiom or Law) was stated by Auguste Kerckhoffs in the 19th century: A cryptosystem should be secure even if everything about the system, except the key, is public knowledge.

  Kerckhoffs' principle was reformulated (perhaps independently) by Claude Shannon as "The enemy knows the system.", which is called Shannon's Maxim.

= Classifying Success in Cryptanalysis =

    Lars Knudsen (1998) classified various types of attack on block ciphers according to the amount and quality of secret information that was discovered:

    * Total Break: The attacker deduces the secret key.
    * Global Deduction: The attacker discovers a functionally equivalent algorithm for encryption and decryption, but without learning the key.
    * Instance (Local) Deduction: The attacker discovers additional plaintexts (or ciphertexts) not previously known.
    * Information Deduction: The attacker gains some Shannon information about plaintexts (or ciphertexts) not previously known.
    * Distinguishing Algorithm: The attacker can distinguish the cipher from a random permutation.

    Similar considerations apply to attacks on other types of cryptographic algorithm.
